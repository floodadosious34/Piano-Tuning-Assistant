# Code Lousiville Python Project

# Piano Tuning Assistant
I am creating a application that will assist a piano technician in the process of tuning a Piano. The app will take any two notes from the musical scale (A-G), and return the interval between the two notes, as well as the coincident partials that correspond to the interval. I am looking to add some sound wave development to the app, but not sure yet.

## Features Included
1. Implement a master loop 
2. Create a list and populate it with several values, retrieve one value and use it in the program. 
3. Create and call at least 3 functions, which return a value that is used in the code of the project.
4. Connects to an external API Kanye West quote generator, and reads out the quote upon exiting the program.


## How to run the project
1. Install requirements
2. Run the program
# python3 piano_assistan_app.py
