# Code Lousiville Python Project

# Piano Tuning Assistant
I am creating a application that will assist a piano technician in the process of tuning a Piano. The app will take any two notes from the musical scale (A-G), and return the interval between the two notes, as well as the coincident partials that correspond to the interval. I am looking to add some sound wave development to the app, but not sure yet.

## Features Included
1. Implement a master loop 
2. Create a list and populate it with several values, retrieve one value and use it in the program. 
3. Create and call at least 3 functions, which return a value that is used in the code of the project.
4. Possibly connect to an external API and read data into the app
5. Create a class, by the name of _, and then create 2 objects of that class and populate it with data.


## How to run the project
