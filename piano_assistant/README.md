# Code Lousiville Python Project

# Piano Tuning Assistant
I am creating a application that will assist a piano technician in the process of tuning a Piano. The app will take any two notes from the mussical scale (A-G), and return the interval between the two notes, as well as the coincident partials that correspond to the interval. I am looking to add some sound wave development to the app, but not asure yet.
